## What is `wini` ?

Wini is a set of templates written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for building websites. Instead of using [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) like other common Rust front-end frameworks, Wini templates rely on server-side rendering and, when needed, [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Other options are also available, like [`htmx`](https://htmx.org/), [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/), and [`_hyperscript`](https://hyperscript.org/). See the integration docs for [`htmx`](https://wini.rocks/doc/htmx) and [Alpine.js](https://wini.rocks/doc/alpinejs).

The goal of Wini is therefore to be **fast**, **lightweight**, and to handle the maximum number of things that can be handled on the server, **server-side**.

Even though Wini doesn't use a JavaScript framework and relies purely on vanilla JavaScript, you still have the possibility of installing packages with [`bun`](https://bun.sh) and using them as you would any JavaScript front-end framework.

For more information about how Wini works and how it handles logic; such as pages, components, middleware, routing and layouts, check: <https://wini.rocks>


## Getting started

### Installation

You can install Wini with `cargo`

```sh
cargo install wini
```

### Create your first Wini project

After the installation of `wini`, you can create a new project with

```sh
wini init
```

## Documentation

All the documentation concerning the inner workings of `wini` and how to work with it are available at: <https://wini.rocks/>.

## State 
Even though Wini works, it's still in a very early state: Things might not always work as expected and there might be some breaking changes in the future; but if you are curious, and you want to help contribute to this project, you can still try it!
