## ü§î What is `wini` ?

Wini is a set of templates written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for building websites. Instead of using [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) like other common Rust front-end frameworks, Wini templates rely on server-side rendering and when needed [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Other options are also available, like [`htmx`](https://htmx.org/), [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/), and [`_hyperscript`](https://hyperscript.org/). (_See the doc for [`htmx`](https://wini.rocks/doc/htmx) and [Alpine.js](https://wini.rocks/doc/alpinejs)._)

The goal of Wini is therefore to be **fast** ‚ö°, **lightweight** ü™∂ and **server-side** üåê oriented.

Even though Wini doesn't use a JavaScript framework and relies purely on vanilla JavaScript, you still have the possibility of installing packages with [`bun`](https://bun.sh) and using them as static files.

## ‚ú® Features
- [Server side rendering](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SSR) (SSR)
- [Static site generation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SSG) (SSG)
- Creation of concepts like [_pages_](https://wini.rocks/doc/concepts/pages), [_components_](https://wini.rocks/doc/concepts/components) and [_layouts_](https://wini.rocks/doc/concepts/layouts)
- Compatible with [axum](https://docs.rs/axum)'s & [tower](https://docs.rs/tower)'s ecosystems
- Compatible with [htmx](https://htmx.org), [alpinejs](https://alpinejs.dev), [hyperscript](https://hyperscript.org) and similar frameworks
- [SEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization) scoping to pages and layouts
- [Caching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)) rules for [`Cache-` headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Caching) and _components_ + _pages_ ([`cached`](http://docs.rs/cached))
- Automatic linking of JavaScript and CSS files
- Default support for [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Scss](https://sass-lang.com)

- Basic scripting automation in bash or [nushell](https://nushell.org) depending on your liking
- Integration with [maud](https://maud.lambda.xyz) for rendering HTML (see [the advantages](https://wini.rocks/doc/why-maud))
- Easily [forkable and self-hostability](https://wini.rocks/doc/hosting_your_template) of your own template

## üèÅ Getting started

### Installation

You can install Wini with `cargo`

## üìÑ Documentation

All the documentation concerning the inner workings of `wini` and how to work with it are available at: <https://wini.rocks/>.

## üöß State 
Even though Wini works, it's still in a very early state: Things might not always work as expected and there might be some breaking changes in the future; but if you are curious, and you want to help contribute to this project, you can still try it!
